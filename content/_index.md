## Online meetings

Join us for our new Scotland-wide Wednesday evening meetings! üõã

Facilitated by LLLGB Leaders from across Scotland, join us for a cosy evening meeting from the comfort of your own home. All welcome from pregnancy onwards, come along with breastfeeding questions or just for a chat.

Every first and third Wednesday of the month at 8pm. If you would like to attend either of these meetings, please use the below registration forms before your first meeting:
